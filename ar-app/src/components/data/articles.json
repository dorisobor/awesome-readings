        "text": "<p>When Jess Michaels isn't obsessively checking her steps on FitBit or watching daytime Court TV, she's a best-selling author who writes historical romances with heroines who speak their mind.</p> <p>Her first foray into publishing began, as many picture the life of an author, with a traditional publishing deal. But after releasing a few books, Michaels decided to turn down an additional deal and try self-publishing.</p> <p><q>I'd begun developing an audience for my books and wanted to try something different. Authors I respected had success and greater control over their work with self-publishing, so I was eager to try it for myself,</q>says Michaels.</p><p>She mastered it quickly and decided to go <q>strictly indie</q> in 2015, using Amazon's <a href=\"https://kdp.amazon.com/\">Kindle Direct Publishing</a> KDP service to publish in both eBook and print. Since her decision to self-publish, she has been on the USA bestseller list ten times. Her husband quit his job at a large technology company and now works with Michaels to run their publishing company.</p> <p><q>I wanted more control over not just the creative writing, but also the marketing strategy, cover art, and other business aspects of publishing. I grew frustrated being unable to make these decisions going the traditional publishing route,</q> she says. <q>I'm both a writer and entrepreneur, and I'm enjoying more creative and financial rewards than I ever have.</q></p> <p>For Michaels, who says the initial idea of going indie was <q>taking a leap off a cliff and hoping you can fly before you crash,</q> the resulting benefits have exceeded her expectations.</p><p>For those authors wrestling with the idea of self-publishing, consider this:</p> <p>- Creative control. Self-publishing a book allows authors to build characters and stories exactly the way they want and, ultimately, retain full rights to their original material.
